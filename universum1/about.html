	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Hi,my name is Blendi Syla and i'm 18 years old,i've always been into Web Developing since i started using network,and im actually very attracted by it,considering the fact that im studying in this specialism makes me really enjoy this,so there is not much about me and web developing,because im a newbie in this field,so i hope i will be fast enough to learn this new language.I'm actually getting better at programming these last couple of days. </p>
